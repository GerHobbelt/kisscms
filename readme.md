Description
-----------
A CMS lightning fast to setup and easy to use The main goal was the creation of an environment to easily create new content on a website while lifting unecessary barriers on extensibility and customization. Although it's origin derives from KISSMVC, a simple PHP MVC framework, it's course is totally diverted and has independednt development.  


Setup
-----
- Extract the archive and place the content of the kisscms folder wherever you want your website. 
- The files in the "html" folder should be placed in your web root. All other files on level above it.
- Open a browser and enter the address of your website. Sample content should already work with no further work.
- Add "/admin" to your web address to be able to administer your site. Default username/password are: admin/pass 

Customization

- Open "index.php" and update the paths according to your server setup.

Upgrading
---------
Although currently there isn't a stellar way of upgrading from previous versions, our aim is to create a simplified process that will require from you to update only the "app" folder of your site. More as we progress on this...


Usage
-----
To create a page, simply enter the address, ex. "mypath/testpage" and in pure wiki-style, the prompt to create the new page will appear. To edit/delete a page you simply click on the corresponding topbar links, available when you are logged in as admin. To extend the website with your own plugins please visit the [kisscms-plugins](http://github.com/makesites/kisscms-plugins) repo which contains examples and walkthroughs how to create your own custom logic...
