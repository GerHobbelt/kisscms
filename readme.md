Description
-----------
A CMS with minimal footprint written in PHP, following best practices in MVC architecture and with main objective to jump start web development by providing a clean and extensible environment. Highlights include an uncluttered administration area, a zero setup process, wiki-style page creation, a template engine with simplified methods and the automated installation for plugins/extensions. 


Setup
-----
KISSCMS may be installed using Composer (getcomoser.org) or by cloning it from its Github repository. 

1. Extract the archive and place the contents of the folder where you want your website to be located. 
2. Place the files in the "html" folder should in your web root. All other folders one directory level above it.
3. Open a browser and enter the address of your website. Sample content should already work with no further effort.
4. Type "/admin" in your web address to enter the administration area. Default (username/password) are: ** admin / admin **


Customization
-------------
The default setup is optimized for a new website with its own domain. If you want an altered setup, please open the file "html/index.php" in a text editor to modify the paths as it's apropriate. The html folder also contains web assets which you can freely modify to create your custom layout. The configuration of basic CMS options is located through the administration bar. For instructions how to extend the CMS with additional logic please refer to the "Reference" section.


Upgrading
---------
If you haven't modified anything in the APP folder, upgrading should be as simple as replacing the APP folder with the latest version. For added security you can rename the old app folder and refer to is as a BASE folder so it will operate as a fallback. If you need further assisctance please send a support ticket through the issue tracker on github:
